              The philosophy of Stellar Aesthetics is not just giving skills and
              training but also the tools required to make your practice a grand
              success.
              <br />
              <br />
              Each of our programs has been designed to give you the confidence
              to start your practice immediately after the program. They are
              complete, self-contained, and cover the entire gamut. With only 10
              participants in every batch and the best trainers,
              <br />
              <br />
              we ensure you get a tremendous amount of Hands-on for every
              procedure included in your program. This is very important. This
              ensures that you are able to perform the cosmetic procedures, on
              your own patients, with complete confidence.
              <br />
              <br />
              Apart from the knowledge about the procedures, we believe that
              knowledge about the medicinal treatment and home care regimen is
              equally important. With our product guides, dealer guides, consent
              forms, and step-by-step protocol guides, we give you the
              foundation stones for your cosmetology practice. <br />

          <br />
          <p>
            We also equip you with the necessary business and marketing skills
            that will help you acquire new patients easily and even stand out
            from your competitors. Our promise is a lifelong one. We are not
            just hand-holding you during the program and while setting up your
            practice, but you will have the security of our lifelong mentorship
            and support.
